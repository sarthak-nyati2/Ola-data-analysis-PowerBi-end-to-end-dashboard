**Ola Data Analytics Project: SQL, Power BI, and Excel**  

I created a demo project analyzing Ola's operational data using SQL, Power BI, and Excel. The workflow involved:  
- **Data Cleaning (Excel):** Prepared raw data for analysis.  
- **Data Analysis (SQL):** Extracted insights through structured queries.  
- **Dashboard (Power BI):** Designed a 4-page interactive report.  

**Dashboard Overview:**  
1. **Overall Summary:** Key metrics and KPIs for a high-level view.  
2. **Vehicle Type Analysis:** Performance breakdown by vehicle type.  
3. **Revenue Analysis:** Trends and patterns in revenue generation.  
4. **Cancellation Analysis:** Insights into ride cancellations and improvement areas.  

This project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, querying, and visualization, providing actionable insights into business operations.
